# LOCALVAULT - LOCAL PASSWORD DATABASE & ENCODER
### Using the website, you can:
- Create a new set of passwords and save them in an encrypted .lclv file, that can only be reopened through this website.
- Option to copy passwords and link directly to the site through the password database.
- Ability to edit and delete password entries.
- Choose your own encryption key so that only the local user who knows the key can access the passwords. (coming soon)
